# NudeBlocker API

An API with just one endpoint that returns "The uploaded photo contains inappropriate content" if image includes any adult/sensitive content or returns "Clean photo" if image is clean. Used ASP.NET Core and Azure Computer Vision of Azure Cognitive Services to analyze the image.

An easy to understand example to try how to use Azure Computer Vision.
